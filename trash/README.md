# S18T
Simple terminal game engine, written in Ruby.

## Getting Started
To use S18T you need to put the source code in the specified directory. It is contained in the "S18T" catalog.
Then, include the file "S18T / S18T.rb" in your program. For exemple:
```
require "path/to/S18T/S18T.rb"
```
That's enough to be able to use S18T.
