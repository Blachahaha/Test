# S18T
Simple terminal game engine, written in Ruby.

## Getting Started
First, download the engine source code (S18T directory) to the empty location. Then, in the new file with the extension .rb, include the file S18T.rb located in the S18T directory. For example:
```
require "/path/to/S18T/S18T.rb"
```
It's enough to use the game engine classes.
